# ModBeeMurcko

A simple python script to be run from e.g. Powershell.
Its purpose is to generate Beemis-Murcko scaffolds, as well as my own modified versions of Beemis-Murcko scaffolds, from a library of SMILES or molecular objects (.mol, .sdf).

As this is my first time using something like GitHub, you should expect basic frameworks and formatting to be non-existent.
